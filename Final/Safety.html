                <h4>Safety</h4>
            <p>
                When working with resin or other chemicals safety precautions are a key factor to consider. Due to the chemical composition of 3D-Printer resin it is a requirement to possess or have access to a Vapour Rated N95 respirator or other chemical rated mask with filters. Work must be done in a ventillated space, ideally an exterior area such as a fully enclosed shed or garage with access to easy ventillation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to a vapour-rated mask or respirator it is also reccomended that any user of a 3D-Printer utilize a pair or more of disposable nitrile gloves. As resin is able to be absorbed through the skin it is also reccomended that a user utilize a chemical suit, or at the least long sleeved clothing that can be easily removed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When working with resin it is also important to keep equipment divided between objects in contact with resin before being cured, and objects that are not in contact with resin until after post processing. It is imperative to understand that no amount of washing will fully remove resin from a container or tool utilized during post processing, as such it is important to use colored labels or keep them separated from other non-resin related activites.
            </p>
            <p> In addition to resin safety one must recall that the chemicals used in the liquid curing processess are highly flammable, Isopropyl alcohol or Ethanol based cleaning products must be kept away from open flames.</p>
            <p>
                All in all, It is important to practice basic chemical safety procedures, in the event resin does get on your skin wipe it off with a clean rag or tissue, and run the area under cool water and soap. skin exposure may not cause immediate reactions, but after periods of proloned exposure an allergic reaction may occur during periods of exposure to the vapours. 
            </p>
            <h4>Safe Disposal of Material</h4>
            <p>It is important to understand that resin is not a natural material, if it seeps into local waterways it may cause the distribution of microplastics. As such any water, isopropyl alcohol, or ethanol utilized in resin printing must be sealed in a container and brought to a chemical disposal plant. In the event that an individual may wish to reuse any liquid material used in post processing it is reccomended they utilize a still in order to evaporate the alcohol in order to separate the contaminated liquid from the liquid resin. </p>
