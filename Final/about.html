            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
                This website was designed to both demonstrate the capabilites of Mars 2 Pro, as well as inform potenial users of resin 3d Printers of information necessary for personal use. The world of 3D-Printing is a complicated and interesting one that requires serious research and consideration before it is entered. While the practice itself is not extremely complicated, the preparation one must make when entering the hobby makes it cost intensive. On average an individual must spend 300-400 dollars to purchase their printer, personal protective equipment, and make modifications to the space that would be utilized.</p>
            <p> 
                The printer used in this process is relatively old, being a second-generation resin 3D-Printer designed by the company elegoo. The printer is a Mars-2 Pro, an improved version of an entry-level desgin for 3D-Printers. Older models such as this require files to be loaded using physical inputs such as through a USB stick or through a direct cable link to the owner's personal computer. It has no connection to the internet and cannot be utilized remotely. The build plate itself is manually adjusted using allen keys and gravity in order to ensure it remains level. Newer models meanwhile possess the ability to be activated remotely, auto levelling for their build plates, and integrated cameras in order to inform the user of errors.
