            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                This website was created as a method of showcasing and demonstating the processess behind 3d-Printing, providing information on safe handling, modelling, and common sources for STL files used in resin 3D-Printing. It also features information on modern hardware, software, and fair use of digital files taken online. Reminder that 3D models are the property of their designers, and that all use for commercial purposes must be approved by those designers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resin 3D-Printing (not to be confused with Plastic 3D-Printing) is the process in which a machine uses focused Ultraviolet light to burn layer, or "slices", onto a flat plane. This is with the aim of creating a model, design, or component from a 3d-Model. These models are referred to as STLs, or Stereolithography files. The purpose of these designs may vary, however with access to a 3D-Printer the limits become that of material and time. The purpose of this website is to inform prospective printers of the steps necessary when working with resin, as well as to offer advice and sources for Stereolithography files.
